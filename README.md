## What It Is

For one of my first JavaScript assignments I was instructed to create a game where a random word was to be drawn from a word bank and the player had to guess the word. Naturally, this soon evolved into a Star Wars themed word game complete with the Star Wars theme song, laser sounds, and guest apperances from Darth Vader and the Emperor!
